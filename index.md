# 👋 _Welcome!_

I’m Matt Baxter — this is my personal space on the internet. From time to time I have grand visions of turning this into the home of my witty, humorous, and insightful weblog that launches me into internet fame. Eventually I chuckle at the thought, think to myself, “Nah, I’m good,” and go back to sipping on my artisinal, handcrafted, Aeropressed cup of coffee.

IRL, I enjoy spending time with my wife and our three kids. We're still trying to figure out this whole “zone defense” thing. I’m also a big fan of that Jesus guy you may have heard about. I’m always up for a good coffee _(as you might have guessed from that delicious cup I mentioned earlier)_, beer, or whiskey and I quite enjoy games of both the “video” and “board” variety. I also have a bad habit of wearing skinny jeans _(or so I'm told)_.

Professionally, I’m a product manager for [Bestow](https://hellobestow.com/ "Bestow"), where we’re making life insurance more accessible for everyone.

If you’d like to send me a digital communication, I’m readily available on <span style="white-space: nowrap;">🐦 [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/mbxtr "@mbxtr on Twitter"), <span style="white-space: nowrap;">💼 [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/mbxtr/en)</span>, and by <span style="white-space: nowrap;">✉️ [email](mailto:matt.baxter@gmail.com)</span>.

Happy interneting! 🤓

_Matt_
