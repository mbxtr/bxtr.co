I'm Matt Baxter, a designer and developer in the Dallas, TX metroplex. While I graduated with a degree in Computer Engineering, I'm passionate about user experience and focus much of my time on design.

I work at [projekt202](http://projekt202.com "projekt202") where I get to help companies solve interesting problems in software, from web to native apps. I'm interested in both the technology and design of software, so I spend a lot of time in both. To me, software isn't just compiled code or perfectly arranged pixels; software is a digital product that people use and experience.

![Baxter Family](about/baxter-family.jpg){: .u-image-left .u-width-50 .u-width-small-100} I'm married to my wonderful wife, Erin (who has an [awesome marriage blog](http://mystery32.com "Mystery32")). I have a son, Isaac, who is almost 2 years old and makes every day fun and exciting. I also have a daughter, Hallie, who is coming in June of 2015. I'm a believer in Jesus Christ, a coffee snob, a gamer, a whiskey and beer drinker, a [doodler](http://sketch.mbxtr.com "My sketch blog"), and I have a bad habit of wearing skinny jeans.
