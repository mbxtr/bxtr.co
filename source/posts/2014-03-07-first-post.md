When I built my first personal site 4 or 5 years ago, I told myself that I was going to update it once every year or so. Of course, I basically never touched it after building it the first time. Oops! This time I decided to really set myself up for success by adding a blog. This way, everyone can actually see how long its been since I've updated anything.

Sarcasm aside, I wanted to have a place online to post things that wouldn't fit on Twitter. Maybe I'll look at this in a few years realizing I haven't updated it again and I'm honestly ok with that. The important thing is, I'll have a place to go to whenever I do want to write about something. Which, by the way, could be about almost anything. I could write about the 10th coffee-making gadget I recently bought, my opinions on "flat" design, or even thoughts on balancing family and work.

Putting this new site together has definitely taken longer than I thought it would, but the process has been at least as important to me as actually getting it out there. Working as a consultant usually means I'm working to deadlines or requirements that someone else has set in place, so it's fun to have something that's free of those pressures. I think that probably makes this site more of an art project than a software project. Although, the thing that it most has in common with software projects is that it will never be "finished." Along with being my place to post thoughts and idea, it'll also be my place to experiment.

I could have made this easier, by using platforms like Wordpress or Squarespace, or even just posting something on Medium when I felt like it. But again, I enjoy the process. I decided to build it on a framework called [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/) which is a great tool if you want to do things the hard way in order to have detailed control of everything.

Thanks for reading; we'll see where this goes.
