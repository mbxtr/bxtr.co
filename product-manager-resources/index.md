I’ve had a people ask from time-to-time for articles that give a good overview of the product management role. After sharing the same links a few times, I decided putting them online where they could be easily referenced made sense. Hopefully this is helpful to others as well!

## Articles about the role of the product manager

Ok, so the first link isn’t an article, but I’ve always loved this clip as it quickly communicates the essence of the product manager role. The following articles all give a well-rounded overview of what a product manager does.

* [Bud Tribble and Steve Jobs describing a Product Manager role in 1986 (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_43XPfJEqWc)
* [What, exactly, is a Product Manager? | Mind the Product](https://www.mindtheproduct.com/what-exactly-is-a-product-manager/)
* [The Product Manager Contribution | Silicon Valley Product Group](https://svpg.com/the-product-manager-contribution/)
* [What Does a Product Manager Do? | Brent Tworetzky](https://medium.com/@tworetzky/what-does-a-product-manager-do-205b40d82da3)

## Product management newsletters

Lately I’ve found that most of the new things that I learn in product come from newsletters. The newsletters I’ve linked to below are those that I consistently glean insights from.

* [Marty Cagan’s SVPG Newsletter](https://svpg.com/articles/)
* [Lenny’s Newsletter](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/subscribe) _(This is a paid newsletter at $150 per year which includes access to a Slack product community, product resources, and live interviews with product leaders — it’s totally worth it)_
* [John Cutler’s “Beautiful Mess”](https://cutlefish.substack.com/)
* [Ken Norton’s “Bringing the Donuts”](https://kennethn.substack.com/)
* [Gibson Biddle’s “Friends of Gib” Newsletter](https://gibsonbiddle.substack.com/)
