                <p>I’m Matt Baxter — this is my personal space on the internet. From time to time I have grand visions of turning this into the home of my witty, humorous, and insightful weblog that launches me into internet fame. Eventually I chuckle at the thought, think to myself, “Nah, I’m good,” and go back to sipping on my artisinal, handcrafted, Aeropressed cup of coffee.</p>
                
                <p>IRL, I enjoy spending time with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/erinbaxterphotography">my wife Erin</a> and our two kids, Isaac and Hallie. I’m also a big fan of that Jesus guy you may have heard about. I’m always up for a good coffee <em>(as you might have guessed from that delicious cup I mentioned earlier)</em>, beer, or whiskey and I quite enjoy games of both the “video” and “board” variety. I also have a bad habit of wearing skinny jeans <em>(or so I'm told)</em>.</p>
                
                <p>Professionally, I’m leading product and design for <a href="http://www.refillwise.com/">RefillWise</a>, helping Americans save money on their prescriptions.</p>
                
                <p>If you’d like to send me a digital communication, I’m readily available on <a href="https://www.twitter.com/mbxtr">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/mbxtr/en">LinkedIn</a>, and by <a href="mailto:matt.baxter@gmail.com">email</a>.</p>
                
                <p>Happy interneting!</p>
