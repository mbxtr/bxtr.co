                <h1>👋 <em>Welcome!</em></h1>

                <p>I’m Matt Baxter — this is my personal space on the internet. From time to time I have grand visions of turning this into the home of my witty, humorous, and insightful weblog that launches me into internet fame. Eventually I chuckle at the thought, think to myself, “Nah, I’m good,” and go back to sipping on my artisinal, handcrafted, Aeropressed cup of coffee.</p>

                <p>IRL, I enjoy spending time with my wife and our three kids. We're still trying to figure out this whole “zone defense” thing. I’m also a big fan of that Jesus guy you may have heard about. I’m always up for a good coffee <em>(as you might have guessed from that delicious cup I mentioned earlier)</em>, beer, or whiskey and I quite enjoy games of both the “video” and “board” variety. I also have a bad habit of wearing skinny jeans <em>(or so I'm told)</em>.</p>
                
                <p>Professionally, I’m a product manager for <a href="https://hellobestow.com/">Bestow</a>, where we’re making life insurance more accessible for everyone.</p>
                
                <p>If you’d like to send me a digital communication, I’m readily available on <span style="white-space: nowrap;">🐦<a href="https://www.twitter.com/mbxtr">Twitter</a></span>, <span style="white-space: nowrap;">💼<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/mbxtr/en">LinkedIn</a></span>, and by <span style="white-space: nowrap;">✉️<a href="mailto:matt.baxter@gmail.com">email</a></span>.</p>
                
                <p>Happy interneting! 🤓</p>
