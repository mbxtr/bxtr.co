                <p>I view this as a place to have some fun with web design and every once in a while write about something I find interesting.</p>
                <p>When I'm not browsing the interwebs, I'm usally spending time with my wife and kiddos or being very obnoxious about coffee. I'm all about that Jesus guy and enjoy talking about theology. I also enjoy playing games of all sorts â€” video games, board games, and even sportsball type games.</p>
                <p>Professionally I'm a product leader at Bestow, building a modern platform for insurance companies looking to make life insurance more accessible to everyone.</p>
                <p>Enjoy your stay!</p>
